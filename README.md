# Student-Certification-Program
A School certifies students who successfully complete a course of study involving a variety
of taught, self-study or project modules. To determine whether or not a student is certified, 
their transcript is checked against a certification criterion. This program stores data for 
modules, students and their transcripts and demonstrates their functionality.
